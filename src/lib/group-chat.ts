//
// Attribution is the whole trick. Every model receives the shared history
// with the OTHER models' lines tagged "[model-name] ..." and its own lines
// untagged, so each participant can tell who said what without any provider
// support for multi-speaker roles.

 *  Bug B3 round 2: the other speakers used to arrive as assistant turns, tagged
 *  but assistant all the same. From round two on that puts two assistant
 *  messages next to each other in every payload, one per speaker, and a
 *  template that demands strict user/assistant alternation raises on it. The
 *  counter-check killed both speakers of a two-model group that way on the
 *  installed 2.6.7 build. A foreign turn is not this model's own speech, so
 *  the honest role for it is user; the [model-name] tag and the system prompt
 *  above say who is talking, which is how attribution worked all along. It
 *  also fixes round one for the second speaker, whose prompt used to end on
